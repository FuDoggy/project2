# PROJECT #2 - EXPRESS BARTENDER

## CONCEPT

This application was designed for the purpose of providing a unique, one-stop application experience where members are able to research and retrieve recipes for their favorite drinks, learn about the history of spirits, add/update their own recipes to our database, and review testimonials.  With most bars and pubs closed due to the pandemic, this application gives the user the opportunity to become their own home bartender.  


## USAGE

This application utilized the Cocktail DB API in order to produce a unique user experience across 3 webpages and 10 website sections.  In the home/landing page, the user is presented with a navigation bar with the following sections:

Home
About
Cocktails
Non-Alcoholic
Spirit Guide
Testimonials
Gallery
Mixologists
Contact
Add Your Own Drink

Upon landing on the sign-up/log-in page page, the user will be asked to sign-up as a member or enter their log-in credentials.  They will then be redirected to the members page and presented with a navigation bar with the above titles.  In the Cocktails section, the user is able to search dynamically (search results change as user types) for their drinks, spirits, or ingredients of choice.  They also have the ability to browse through a list of randomly generated drinks from the database.  In addition, users may add, update, and delete drink recipes to the database.  The application will also capture their submissions on their member profiles for future reference.  The Spirit Guide offers information and history on five of the most common spirits.

## CHALLENGES

There were a few back-end API issues which took some time to resolve. Among those challenges were customizing the database to fit our objectives.  The information that we received from the Cocktail DB API was not formatted and didn't offer a functional foundation for our app.  On the front-end side, we encountered several challenges with navigating through the Bootstrap template's configuration and structure.  

## SUCCESSES

We successfully executed a well-designed app that is both highly unique and useful. We were very collaborative and communicated well. We held scrum meetings before starting work on a daily basis to collectively share what we worked on the day before, what we would be working on that day, and any problems that we were facing. By doing this daily, we were able to stay on top of issues and to proactively discuss potential challenges that may be coming down the road. We were also able to utilize Agile methodology to complete small concept pieces of the project in order to test functionality and verify design.




## DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

The groundwork has been laid, but there are several enhancements that could greatly improve the user experience:

Development of an occasion section that matches user with drinks that are appropriate for particular occasions (i.e. weddings, Valentine's Day, etc.)

Development of a profile tracking system that keeps track of user preferences and generates drink recommendations based on those preferences/searches.  

Allow users to input missing ingredients in drink recipes and connect them with local retailers of those ingredients. 

Ability to add/save testimonials
