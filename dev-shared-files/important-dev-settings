-------------DEV SETTINGS----------------------
tables are reinitialized upon server startup and database sync, in server.js
db.sequelize.sync({force:true}) => set to false for deployment

password strength is always strong, in api-routes.js under api/signup
=> add 'STRONG_PASSWORD=yes'  to .env
=> comment out or remove for deployment

bypass login page, using 'BYPASS_AUTHENTICATION=yes' in .env
=> This will cause local storage to break, since it stores the email on login
=> remove lines from isAuthenticated.js before deployment

Remember to delete 
require("dotenv").config();
from files as well, from api-routes.js, isAuthenticated.js


for api routes => make accessible only if req.user => so that api can only be accessed when logged in
