// passport runs on a session - the cookie expires upon session close
// the cookie provided by passport here is good for a session
// the isAuthenticate function then uses the cookie provided by passport
    // every time a protected route is accessed

// in order to add an admin route, we can attach a property
// to the user object: user.admin. To utilize this, we would have 
// an isAdmin() middleware, with next() routes, etc.
// the admin could have a specific email or username
